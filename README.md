# Evolution of Acetobacter
For the selected gene the student has to obtain,  
- The WPGMA tree 
- The Neighbor Joining tree .
Compare the evolutionary rate of each gene and verify if horizontal gene transfer has taken place.

The output which we got from Clustal X and our lab algorithms were bench marked with MEGA-X. In MEGA-X with the FASTA output which we obtained from CLUSTAL-X the tree can be obtained directly. It is very user friendly as the user only has to choose between the tree category mainly in this case. Even though Clustal -X didnâ€™t have the option of a WPGMA, many other tree options were available.

The main reasons for the results being different slightly, mainly due to the pairwise deletion done in the MEGA-X functionality.
